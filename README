requires a leap motion controller

mpu.py is a server to control windows smoothly

swipe.py watches for swipes, does some basic processing, and hands
data off to mpu.py as if the swipes applied a force to the window

requires xdotool

assumes window decorations offset x by 1 and y by 45, which are the
defaults for my fluxbox
